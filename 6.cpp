// Railway Station
// Problem Description
// Given schedule of trains and their stoppage time at a Railway Station, find minimum number of platforms needed.

// Note -

// If Train A's departure time is x and Train B's arrival time is x, then we can't accommodate Train B on the same platform as Train A.

// Constraints
// 1 <= N <= 10^5

// 0 <= a <= 86400

// 0 < b <= 86400

// Number of platforms > 0

// Input
// First line contains N denoting number of trains.

// Next N line contain 2 integers, a and b, denoting the arrival time and stoppage time of train.

// Output
// Single integer denoting the minimum numbers of platforms needed to accommodate every train.

// Time Limit
// 1

// Examples
// Example 1

// Input

// 3

// 10 2

// 5 10

// 13 5

// Output

// 2

// Explanation

// The earliest arriving train at time t = 5 will arrive at platform# 1. Since it will stay there till t = 15, train arriving at time t = 10 will arrive at platform# 2. Since it will depart at time t = 12, train arriving at time t = 13 will arrive at platform# 2.

/*
Algorithm:
Sort the arrival and departure time of trains.
Create two pointers i=0, and j=0 and a variable to store ans and current count plat
Run a loop while i<n and j<n and compare the ith element of arrival array and jth element of departure array.
if the arrival time is less than or equal to departure then one more platform is needed so increase the count, i.e. plat++ and increment i
Else if the arrival time greater than departure then one less platform is needed so decrease the count, i.e. plat++ and increment j
Update the ans, i.e ans = max(ans, plat).
Implementation: This doesnâ€™t create a single sorted list of all events, rather it individually sorts arr[] and dep[] arrays, and then uses merge process of merge sort to process them together as a single sorted array.
